**Who am I?**
I am a M.Sc. Sociologist from Aalborg University (2017), and B.Sc. Data Analyst from Dania Academy (2022). I'm especially intersted in using data science to support decision-making in the public sector.

**What is this?**
In order to practice my coding skills, I regularly do my own data science projects. On this blog I plan to gather these projects and put them on display for others to see. At the moment I solely work in R, and strive to find solutions using the tidyverse-principles.
