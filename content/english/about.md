**Who am I?**

I'm a data analyst with a background in social science. I'm especially interested in applying my data science skills to decision-making in the societal problems facing the public sector.

**What is this?**

I regularly do my own data science projects in order to improve my skills. On this blog I plan to gather these projects and put them on display for others to see.
