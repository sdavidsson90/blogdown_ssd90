This is a test............ (if someone thinks about this - i'm testing)


**Who am I?**

I'm a data analyst with a background in social science. I'm especially interested in using data science to support decision-making in the public sector.




**What is this?**

In order to practice my coding skills, I regularly do my own data science projects. On this blog I plan to gather these projects and put them on display for others to see. At the moment I solely work in R, and strive to find solutions using the tidyverse-principles.
